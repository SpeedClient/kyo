    Practitioners emphasize the importance of robust processes when deploying distributed ledger in production. Early adopters of distributed ledger have learned valuable lessons about risk management and resilience. Education and continuous learning will determine who benefits most from consensus over the coming years. In practical implementations, scalability often requires multidisciplinary approaches to succeed.
