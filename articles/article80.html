    Early adopters of tokens have learned valuable lessons about risk management and resilience. There are trade-offs between innovation speed and safety when applying interoperability widely. At its core, distributed ledger reshapes how people and organizations approach long-standing problems. Recent advances in consensus show the potential to scale solutions previously thought impossible.
